  storyText: "Squeezing and shaking your hands as hard as you can, but trying to
    make as little noise as possible, the knot that is firmly starts to loosen a
    bit.\n\nAlthough you put an astronomical effort to be as quiet as a it gets,
    a sharp hissle fills the room as you mistakenly pushes a small sized wooden wardrobe
    that you once leaned your heavy head to rest.\n\nYou hear spaced heavy footsteps
    coming. They sound like someone is crushing a stone with a hammer.\n\nWhat's
    your next action:\n\t1. Pretend to be asleep;\n\t2. Continue to force to loosen
    your hands."
