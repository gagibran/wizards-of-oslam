  storyText: "You peak through the door and see a big straight corridor, with at
    least a dozen doors. No one is standing guard. But as the CEO of Asla Inc., the
    biggest cybersecurity company in the Denver area, you know that this won't be
    an easy escape. There are probably a lot of hidden cameras in the area.\r\n\r\nIn
    fact, you notice one right above your head, broadcasting the entire spectacle
    to your abductors. You probably don't have enough time. You quietly sneak through
    the corridor, since you don't know if someone's standing guard in the other rooms.
    You hear load moans coming from some rooms. One of them, the last one, was opened.
    You peak through and can't believe your luck. An intact, unguarded matrix terminal.\r\n\r\nWhat
    is your next action?\r\n\t1. Connect into the matrix with your cyberterminal;\r\n   
    \t2. Continue on exploring."
