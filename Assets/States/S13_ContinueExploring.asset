  storyText: "You ignore the matrix, afraid of it having firewalls that could melt
    your brain. You go straight to the final door at the end of the corridor. As
    soon as you open the door, you get hit in the head by a bulkier goon. You are
    unconscious. \r\n\r\nYou wake up realizing that two elves are carrying you to
    a room with a chair filled with wires and a terminal. They know that you can
    access the matrix. As they hook you up in the chair, you try desperately to think
    of a way to commit suicide. If they extract the things that you know, Denver
    is definitely doomed. But it is helpless. \r\n\r\nThey force you to go inside
    the matrix, hacking into your memories. They got everything they need. You are
    now a useless shell to them. You are killed on the spot.\r\n\r\nPress Enter to
    continue."
