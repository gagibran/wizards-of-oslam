  storyText: 'During the very same night, raid with your most powerful street samurais,
    mages, and deckers was successfully conducted. The head of a powerful mage by
    the name of Alladuhl, the cult''s leader, was brought to your desk by your team
    of mercenaries.



    The Wizards of Oslam, as they were called, were a fast
    growing cult in which had mainly mages and shamans, that, through dark magic,
    were trying to create a great dragon, Oslam, to manipulate the whole East Cost,
    going head to head with the other great dragons. Seeking resources and politically
    control the Denver area, you had been held captive. Were it not for your great
    judgment and expertise, you would have had your brain hacked and Denver would
    certainly fall, making it a great first step for the cult.



    Congratulations,
    runner! Press Enter to play again...'
