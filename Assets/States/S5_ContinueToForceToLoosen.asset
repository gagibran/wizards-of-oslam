  storyText: "After some more shaking and contortion, you are able to freely move
    your hands, making it easier to untie the knot locking your feet together and
    remove your muzzler.\r\n\r\nYou hide behind the door, waiting for your visitor
    to arrive. The stomping footsteps finally cease. The door clicks and cracks open.
    You see a pitch-dark, gigantic human with a robotic left arm.\r\n\r\nAs soon
    as he makes his first step inside the room, you abruptly jumps in his back, fiercely
    crushing his neck with your forearms and covering his mouth with your right hand.
    He tries to fight back, but can't reach you. You choke him dead.\r\n\r\nWhat
    is your next action?\r\n\t1. Sneak through the door to the next room;\r\n\t2.
    Rush to the exit."
