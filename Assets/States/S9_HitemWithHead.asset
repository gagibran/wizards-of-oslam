  storyText: 'You hit him hard, right on the nose. Bleed pours out of it, like a
    waterfall. You fall on the ground, still firmly tied up. He proceeds to violently
    and coldly kick you on the head hard. You pass out. After sometime, you wake
    up realizing that two elves are carrying you to a room with a chair filled with
    wires and a terminal. They know that you can access the matrix.



    As they
    hook you up in the chair, you try desperately to think of a way to commit suicide.
    If they extract the things that you, the CEO of the giant cybersecurity company
    Asla Inc., the whole area of Denver, which is under this very company, is definitely
    doomed. But it is helpless. They force you to go inside the matrix, hacking into
    your memories. They got everything they need. You are now a useless shell to
    them. You are killed on the spot.



    Press Enter to continue.'
