  storyText: "As you close your eyes, you lay down on the ground, you try to push
    the blindfold back onto your eyes by shaking your head awkwardly. The deafening,
    spaced footsteps are approaching quickly. They stop. After a couple of minutes
    of maddening silence, the door clicks and makes a cracking sound. The stomping
    footsteps get closer.\r\n\r\nHarsh hand hold you up violently. The blindfold
    comes off. You see a pitch-dark, gigantic human. He has robotic left leg and
    left arm. He harshly removes the piece of silk that was onto your mouth.\r\n\r\n\"You
    weren't trying to leave our humble abode, were you? Fucking corporate scum!\r\"\n\r\nWhat
    is your next action?\r\n\t1. (Intimidate) \"As soon as I get out, this place
    will be blown to hell.\";\r\n\t2. Hit'em with your head."
