  storyText: 'The Wizards of Oslam, a now well known group of mages and shamans that
    controls the Denver area with fear and brutality, is one step closer in achieving
    their objective: creating a great dragon, Oslam, in order to take the whole East
    Cost, going head to head with the other great dragons.



    Their leader, a
    powerful mage by the name of Alladuhl, conducted a raid into the headquarters
    of Asla Inc., exploiting every little opened areas and devastating every member
    of the company, making an altar in the CEO room with all of their heads, with
    yours, the once great Cole Pane, leader of the most prominent cybersecurity company
    in Denver, in the center.



    With the fall of Denver and Asla Inc., they
    have almost all the resources required to achieve this grim future.
