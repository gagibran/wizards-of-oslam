  storyText: "With your hands and feet tied, you put a humongous effort to try to
    find a sharp object. There it is. A rusty almost loosen nail, coming from an
    empty wardrobe that you were leaning to sleep.\r\n\r\nAs you pulled the nail
    with your mouth, some of your incisors break, but you can't deal with the pain
    right now. It's time to go.\r\n\r\nWith this nail and some contortion, you are
    able to cut your hands and feet loose.\r\n\r\nWhat is your next action?\r\n\r\t1.
    Sneak through the door to the next room;\r\n\t2. Rush to the exit."
