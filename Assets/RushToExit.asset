  storyText: 'You peak through the door and see a big straight corridor, with at
    least a dozen doors. No one is standing guard. But as the CEO of Asla Inc., the
    biggest cybersecurity company in the Denver area, you know that this won''t be
    an easy escape. There are probably a lot of hidden cameras in the area. In fact,
    you notice one right above your head, broadcasting the entire spectacle to your
    abductors. You probably don''t have enough time. You begin rushing your way to
    the last door at the end of the corridor.

    

    As soon as you open the
    door, you get hit in the head by a bulkier goon. You are unconscious. You wake
    up realizing that two elves are carrying you to a room with a chair filled with
    wires and a terminal. They know that you can access the matrix. As they hook
    you up in the chair, you try desperately to think of a way to commit suicide.
    If they extract the things that you know, Denver is definitely doomed. But it
    is helpless. They force you to go inside the matrix, hacking into your memories.
    They got everything they need. You are now a useless shell to them. You are killed
    on the spot.

    

    Press Enter to continue.'
