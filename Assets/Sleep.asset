  storyText: 'You decide that the best option is to sleep and to wait for your rescue.
    Cole Pane, the brilliant CEO of the giant cybersecurity Asla Inc., that controls
    the region of Denver cannot be missing for too long. It''s dangerous. Too much
    information can be extracted.

    

    You lay your head down, leaning on
    an empty wardrobe and sleep. Sometime passes. You wake up realizing that two
    elves are carrying you to a room with a chair filled with wires and a terminal.
    They know that you can access the matrix.

    

    As they hook you up in
    the chair, you try desperately to think of a way to commit suicide. If they extract
    the things that you know, Denver is definitely doomed. But it is helpless. They
    force you to go inside the matrix, hacking into your memories. They got everything
    they need. You are now a useless shell to them. You are killed on the spot.

    

    Press
    Enter to continue.'
