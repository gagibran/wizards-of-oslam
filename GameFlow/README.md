# S.1 Inside the Cult Shop
After some titanic effort, you were able to loosen the knot that was locking a blindfold onto your eyes.

You perceive bland gentle mark that was left by the blindfold onto the stubby skin on your cheeks.Your hands and feet are steadily tighten and squeezed against each other.

A piece of soft silk is also fastened against your teeth and tongue.

What's your next action:

1. Force to loosen your hands and feet;
2. Scream for help;
3. Sleep.

# S.2 Loosen Hands and Feet
Squeezing and shaking your hands as hard as you can, but trying to make as little noise as possible, the knot that is firmly starts to loosen a bit.

Although you put an astronomical effort to be as quit as a it gets, a sharp hissing fills the room as you mistakenly pushes a small sized wooden wardrobe that you once leaned your heavy head to rest.

You hear spaced heavy footsteps coming. They sound like someone is crushing a stone with a hammer.

What's your next action:

1. Pretend to be asleep;
2. Continue to force to loosen your hands.

# S.3 Scream for help

You inflate your lungs as harder as you can and let out a massive scream for help, although  hoping that any individual would come for the rescue.

As the euphoria settles, a horrid wave of anxiety rushes through your body, making you instantly regret this decision. You hear quick, angry footsteps approaching. The door slammed open, breaking its lock in the process.

You see a pitch-dark, distorted male human, he is using a fine grey trench coat. You noticed that, in his right arm, he carries a hand-crafted steel knife, that is about 30 cm or so long.

The huge creature-like fiercely shoves his robotic left arm into your mouth, ripping the soft silk that muzzled it. He reaches for your tongue and, before you realize the current situation, he cuts it clean with the steel knife. You let out an even louder scream.

"Next time I'll rip your fucking dick off with my bare hands! Disgusting corporate trash!" He shouts, as he halts the bleeding with a high-tech cauterizer. He leaves the room, slamming the door shut.

What is your next action:
1. Try to find a sharp object;
2. Try to loosen your hands.

# S.5 Pretend to be Asleep

As you close your eyes, you lay down on the ground, next to the wardrobe, you try to push the blindfold back onto your eyes, shaking your head awkwardly. You hear deafening, spaced footsteps, as if someone was smashing a stone with a hammer, in the distance. They are getting louder and louder. Your lips start shaking as they approach.

Silence. Someone is at the door. Your start to anxiously count the seconds until something, anything at all happens. After counting roughly 10 minutes of maddening silence echoes through the room the loudest click you have ever heard from dead bolt in the door lock. Another click, this time coming from the latch bolt. The door makes a cracking sound. The stomping footsteps get closer.

Mighty, harsh hands crunch your cheekbones as you are held up violently. The blindfold comes off. A human, pitch-dark, distorted, bruised face, as if someone punched it uninterruptedly for an entire day, appears. Cerulean left eye, pale, lifeless right eye. The bald creature is using a grayish trench coat. It has a robotic left leg and left arm.

"You weren't trying to leave our humble abode, were you? Fucking corporate scum!

He harshly removes the piece of silk that was onto your mouth.

Your next action:

1. (Intimidate) "As soon as I get out, this place will be blown to hell."
2. Hit'em with your head.
